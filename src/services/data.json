            "disclaimer_text": "Our examination of the electrical system includes a visual examination of the exposed and accessible branch circuits, wiring, service panel, over current protection devices, lighting fixtures, switches, and receptacles. Service equipment, proper grounding, wiring methods and bonding are focal points. We inspect for adverse conditions such as lack of grounding and bonding, over-fusing, exposed wiring, open-air wire splices, reverse polarity and defective GFCI's. The hidden nature of the electrical wiring prevents inspection of every length of wire or their connections. Telephone, video, cable, audio, security systems and other low voltage systems were not included in this inspection unless specifically noted. We recommend you have the seller or a specialist demonstrate the serviceability or locations of these systems to you if necessary. Any electrical repairs attempted by anyone other than a licensed electrician should be approached with caution. The power to the entire house should be turned off prior to beginning any repair efforts, no matter how trivial the repair may seem. Aluminum wiring requires periodic inspection and maintenance by a licensed electrician. Operation of time clock motors is not verified. Inoperative light fixtures often lack bulbs or have dead bulbs installed. Light bulbs are not changed during the inspection, due to time constraints. Smoke Alarms should be installed within 15 feet of all Bedroom doors and in Bedrooms. These units should be tested monthly.<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 18\">\n\t\t\t<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"column\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<p><span style=\"font-size: 10.000000pt; font-family: 'ArialMT'\">There are a wide variety of electrical systems with an even greater variety of components, and any one\nparticular system may not conform to current standards or provide the same degree of service and safety.\nWhat is most significant about electrical systems however is that the national electrical code [NEC] is not\nretroactive, and therefore many residential systems do not comply with the latest safety standards. Regardless,\nwe are not electricians and in compliance with our standards of practice we only test a representative number\nof switches and outlets and do not perform load-calculations to determine if the supply meets the demand.\nHowever, in the interests of safety, we regard every electrical deficiency and recommended upgrade as a latent\nhazard that should be serviced as soon as possible, and that the entire system be evaluated and certified as\nsafe by an electrician. Therefore, it is essential that any recommendations that we may make for service or\nupgrades should be completed before the close of escrow, because an electrician could reveal additional\ndeficiencies or recommend some upgrades for which we would disclaim any further responsibility. However, we\ntypically recommend upgrading outlets to have ground fault protection, which is a relatively inexpensive but\nessential safety feature. These outlets are often referred to as GFCI's, or ground fault circuit interrupters and,\ngenerally speaking, have been required in specific locations for more than thirty years, beginning with\nswimming pools and exterior outlets in 1971, and the list has been added to ever since: bathrooms in 1975,\ngarages in 1978, spas and hot tubs in 1981, hydro tubs, massage equipment, boat houses, kitchens, and\nunfinished basements in 1987, crawlspaces in 1990, wet bars in 1993, and all kitchen countertop outlets with\nthe exception of refrigerator and freezer outlets since 1996. Similarly, AFCI's or arc fault circuit interrupters,\nrepresent the very latest in circuit breaker technology, and have been required in all bedroom circuits since\n2002. However, inasmuch as arc faults cause thousands of electrical fires and hundreds of deaths each year,\nwe categorically recommend installing them at every circuit as a prudent safety feature.&nbsp;</span></p>\n\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t\t</div>\n\t\t</div>",
