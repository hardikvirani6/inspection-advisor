 `AdobePublish` is the base class for publishing projects and works in progress to the Behance network,
 as well as editing Behance profiles.
 
 Content can be published in one of two formats:
 Work in Progress: a single image, commonly used to represent an unfinished work
 Project: a composed piece, including one or more images/video embeds, and a cover image
 
 Project images can be added from a userâ€™s Photo Library as well as from their Creative Cloud assets.
 
 Users can edit their profiles.
 
 Users can share their work to Facebook/Twitter upon publishing.
